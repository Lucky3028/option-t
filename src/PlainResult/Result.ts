/**
 *
 *  This is [_result type_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Result_type).
 *
 *  ## CAUTION:
 *
 *  ### Be careful to use `===` or `Object.is()` to compare the equality of this type
 *
 *  You should use `equal` operator to check the equality for two objects of this type
 *  instead of `===` or `Object.is()`.
 *  Operators for this type sometimes return the inputted object directly
 *  to avoid an unnecessary objecti allocation.
 *
 *  We use this design by the assumption that we would not compare `a` and `b` usually in the following case.
 *  It usually suggest some design problems if you would like to compare these `a` and `b`.
 *
 *  ```typescript
 *  const a = createOk(val);
 *  const b = andThen(a, someOperation);
 *  ```

    // To keep the same shape (hidden class or structure) with the other.

    // As I remembered, when I had introduced this property in early 2018,
    // I tested a shape transition for some engines. By their results,
    // I concluded `Ok` and `Err` should have same properties to make to use the same shape.
    //
    //  - Modern JSVMs in web engines used a single shape.
    //      - Inline cache would be monomorphic.
    //      - I tested JavaScriptCore (for Safari 15.4), SpiderMonkey (for Firefox v99), and V8 9.9.
    //  - Old V8 used an another hidden class if `val` is `number` or others.
    //      - Inline cache for an object taking this type would be polymorphic.
    //      - But we can assume that it will not be megamorphic by the observation.
    //
    // Of course, this decision has some drawbacks for users of this package.
    //
    //  1. If user use `Object.hasOwnProperty` or `for-in` statement fot this object,
    //     this property will be leaked accidentally.
    //     However, we don't think it is a common operation for user because we provide `is~~()` function
    //     and user will not do their operations generally for a "container" object like this type.
    //
    //  2. If user will use `const { ok, err }` = Ok;`, then val will be `null`.
    //     We can say same thing for `Err`.
    //
    // By these reasons, we should not recommend to create this object without this factory function.
    // User can create this object by hand. But it's fragile for the future change. So We should not recommend it.
